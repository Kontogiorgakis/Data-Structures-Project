# Data-Structures-Project
 Illustrating list and tree data structures through an interactive Among Us-inspired visualization



## Introduction


The "Data-Structures-Project" is an interactive visualization inspired by the game Among Us, showcasing the utilization of **tree and linked list data structures**. It employs a circular doubly linked list to represent players, detailing attributes like ID, alien status, and suspicion level. Tasks are managed through sorted singly linked lists, complemented by a general task list sorted by difficulty. As crewmates complete tasks, they're moved from individual task lists to a completion stack, demonstrating effective data structure usage within a game-like environment. This project serves as an educational tool, illustrating practical applications of data structures in a fun and engaging manner.
